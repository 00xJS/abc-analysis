# Project Title: ABC Applied Analysis

## Project Goal:
The goal of this project was to demonstrate and showcase the skills and knowledge I acquired during my studies, specifically within the Applied Business Data Analytics Certificate program at Arizona State University.

## Project Background:
I completed the Applied Business Data Analytics Certificate program at ASU, which consisted of six courses and 18 college credits.  The program covered Business Process Management, Computer Applications and Information, Advanced Excel in Business, Location Analytics in Business, Business Intelligence, and Business Data Visualization.

At the project's start, the City of Buckeye lacked an organized Pokémon GO community. My objective was to address this gap and establish a thriving local player base. Initially, I joined an existing community to gain experience in community building, event hosting, and data collection. After several months of gathering data, insights, and building connections, unforeseen circumstances required me to create a new community from scratch. [Join the 'Active Buckeye Community on Campfire!](https://campfire.onelink.me/eBr8?af_dp=campfire://&af_force_deeplink=true&deep_link_sub1=cj1jbHVicyZjPTU2NTY0MjI4LTc0YmMtNDZkZC1iZTU1LWQ3NjIyOTc3ZGM1NSZpPXRydWU=)

## Project Breakdown:
My initial observations within the pre-existing community revealed a lack of consistent leadership. The host's infrequent attendance at meetups resulted in disorganized gatherings and a lack of direction for players. I leveraged my skills and knowledge to address these issues by implementing structured processes and event planning.

A key improvement was the proactive scheduling of events as soon as information became available. Previously, events were often planned only one to three days in advance, limiting the ability of players with family or other commitments to participate. Pre-scheduling provided ample lead time for planning.

To streamline event descriptions and simplify relevent communication, I developed a standardized format using the "[Sundance deGen](https://github.com/00xJS/sundance-dgen)" This ensured consistency and clarity in event information.

Further analysis of event types and processes highlighted inefficiencies in raid organization. Instead of players arriving at different locations within the park, I implemented a centralized meeting point and standardized event procedures to maximize efficiency and player participation. I created visual maps using in-game Points of Interest (POIs) and shared them on Campfire, clearly indicating meeting locations and event expectations.

## Exploratory Data Analysis: 
- Which type of events are most popular based on check-in data?
  - Gigantamax events have the highest average check-ins (31).
- What event type has the most total check-ins overall?
  - Community Day events lead with 78 check-ins, followed by Max Mondays with 75.
- What day of the week is most popular based on average check-ins?
  - Max Monday events have the highest average check-in rate, likely due to the draw of the Legendary Trio Birds.
- What were the top 5 community events so far?
  - The most popular events were Gigantamax Kingler (33 check-ins), Gigantamax Lapras (31), Shadow Ho-Oh (27), Articuno Max Monday (27), and Zapdos Max Monday (25).
- Of the three factions (Mystic, Valor, Instinct), which is the most popular using Max Monday data?
  - Mystic is the most popular faction based on participation at Max Monday events.

## Conclusion:
This project successfully demonstrates the practical application of the skills and knowledge acquired during the ASU Applied Business Data Analytics Certificate program. By addressing the lack of an organized Pokémon GO presence in Buckeye, Arizona, the project showcases the ability to leverage data analytics to build and grow a thriving community.

Through the implementation of business process management principles, advanced Excel skills, location analytics, business intelligence, and data visualization techniques, significant improvements were made to community organization and engagement. The project's key accomplishments include:

Establishing structured event planning processes, including pre-scheduling and standardized event descriptions.
Optimizing event logistics through centralized meeting points and clear communication of event procedures using visual aids.

Conducting data-driven analysis to understand community preferences and participation patterns.
The exploratory data analysis provided valuable insights, revealing the popularity of Gigantamax and Community Day events, the impact of specific in-game content (Legendary Birds) on attendance, and the dominance of the Mystic faction. These insights inform targeted event planning and resource allocation, maximizing community engagement and satisfaction.

Despite the initial setback of having to rebuild the community & dataset, the project successfully transformed a disorganized group into a well-structured and actively participating community. This project underscores the ability to not only analyze data but also to utilize those insights to drive positive change, build a successful community, and demonstrate resilience in the face of challenges. It effectively bridges the gap between academic learning and real-world application, showcasing the power of data analytics in community building.
